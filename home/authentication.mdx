## Overview

When initiating requests to the UnifyX API, it is essential to include the necessary authentication parameters to establish your identity as an authorized user.

There are two primary authentication protocols:
1. UnifyX API Key
2. Connector Tokens

<Info>
Credentials obtained through these protocols must be incorporated into the headers of each request sent to the UnifyX API.

## UnifyX API Key
For any communication with the UnifyX API, it is crucial to have an API key to authenticate yourself as an authorized user.

<Note>It is recommended to securely store your access key after its creation in UnifyX</Note>

In case you no longer have access to your key, you have the option to regenerate you UnifyX API Key in [API Key](https://demo.unifyx.dev/settings/keys) Tab in Settings.

This practice is crucial for authorizing your Merge API requests effectively. Ensure that this specific header is incorporated in every request, adhering to the following format:


`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_UNIFYX_API_KEY`
