This endpoint creates a Timesheet Entry in the connected HRIS via Bindbee's unified **Time Sheet Entry** model.

## Provider-specific behavior

Different HRIS systems can have slightly different requirements and behaviors when creating timesheet entries. Use the accordions below to see details for each provider.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bamboo HR">
    <p>
      When the underlying HRIS is <strong>Bamboo HR</strong>, a Timesheet Entry can be created using a payload like:
    </p>
    ```json
    {
      "employee": "019ab506-66a2-7f6e-b8da-09d3579a534e",
      "date": "2025-11-24",
      "start_time": "2025-11-24T08:00:00Z",
      "end_time": "2025-11-24T17:00:00Z"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
{/* Add more provider-specific accordions here as you support additional HRIS integrations */}
