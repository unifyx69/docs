This endpoint creates a Timesheet Entry in the connected HRIS via Bindbee's unified **Time Sheet Entry** model.

## Provider-specific behavior

Different HRIS systems can have slightly different requirements and behaviors when creating timesheet entries. Use the accordions below to see details for each provider.
