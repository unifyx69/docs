This endpoint creates an Employee Payroll Run in the connected HRIS via Bindbee's unified **Employee Payroll Runs** model.

## Provider-specific behavior

Different HRIS systems can have slightly different requirements and behaviors when creating payroll runs. Use the accordions below to see details for each provider.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workday">
    <p>
      When the underlying HRIS is <strong>Workday</strong>, an `earning` can be created using a payload like:
    </p>
    ```json
    {
      "employee": "019b2647-8e14-7fcf-aa9e-aeff6ab205b2",
      "start_date": "2025-12-01",
      "end_date": "2025-12-31",
      "earnings":
      [
        {
          "type": "Workday_Earning_Code",
          "amount": 200,
          "id": "W_1042S_2015"
        }
      ],
    }
    ```
    <p>
      Similarly, a `deduction` can be created using a payload like:
    </p>
    ```json
    {
      "employee": "019b2647-8e14-7fcf-aa9e-aeff6ab205b2",
      "start_date": "2025-12-01",
      "end_date": "2025-12-31",
      "deductions":
      [
        {
          "type": "Workday_Deduction_Code",
          "amount": 200,
          "id": "W_1042S_2015"
        }
      ],
    }
    ```

    ### Important note
    - For Workday, you can add either `earnings` or `deductions` at a time - you cannot add both simultaneously.
    - You can only add 1 `earning` or `deduction` at a time, no more than that.
    - `payroll_run` field must be set to **null** for Workday integration.

    <p>
    The possible types for `earnings` are: 
    - **Workday_Earning_Code**
    - **WID**
    </p>

    <p>
    The possible types for `deductions` are:
    - **Workday_Deduction_Code**
    - **WID**
    </p>
