This endpoint creates a Timeoff Entry in the connected HRIS via Bindbee's unified **Time Off** model.

## Provider-specific behavior

Different HRIS systems can have slightly different requirements and behaviors when creating timeoff entries. Use the accordions below to see details for each provider.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bamboo HR">
    <p>
      When the underlying HRIS is <strong>Bamboo HR</strong>, a Timesheet Entry can be created using a payload like:
    </p>
    ```json
    {
        "employee": "01929f6e-c6c1-74b4-8119-a7d9efc0c8b8",
        "amount": 8,
        "start_time": "2024-09-04T08:00:00Z",
        "end_time": "2024-09-04T16:00:00Z",
        "request_type": "VACATION"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
{/* Add more provider-specific accordions here as you support additional HRIS integrations */}
