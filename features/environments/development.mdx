## Overview

The Development environment is a sandbox for building and testing your Bindbee integrations. This environment is completely isolated from Production and has no limits on the number of connectors you can create.

## Development API Key

Your Development API key (`dev_api_key`) is used exclusively to access the Development environment. It cannot be used to access the Production environment.

### Sharing Development Keys

Development API keys can be safely shared within your team for development and testing purposes.

### Managing Your Development API Key

You can view and regenerate your Development API key in the [API Keys](https://app.bindbee.dev/settings/keys) section of your Bindbee dashboard.

### Authentication

Include your Development API key in the `Authorization` header:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DEV_API_KEY`

## Environment Isolation

The Production and Development environments are completely isolated:
- Development API keys only access Development data
- Production API keys only access Production data
- Connectors and data do not transfer between environments

## Unlimited Connectors

The Development environment has no limit on the number of connectors you can create, allowing you to test as many integrations as needed without restrictions.
