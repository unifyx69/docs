## Overview

The Development environment is a sandbox designed for building and testing your Bindbee integrations. It is intended strictly for non-production use and is completely isolated from the Production environment.

<Info>
  The Development environment allows unrestricted testing without impacting live
  production data.
</Info>

## Development API Key

Your Development API key (`dev_api_key`) is used exclusively to access the Development environment. It cannot be used to access the Production environment.

<Note>
  Development API keys should only be used for testing and should never be used
  in production applications.
</Note>

### Sharing Development Keys

Development API keys are intended for testing purposes only and can be safely shared within your team for development and testing workflows.

## Authentication

When making requests to the Bindbee API in the Development environment, include your Development API key in the `Authorization` header using the **Bearer** prefix:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DEV_API_KEY`

## Connector Behavior

### Sync Configuration

Connectors created using Development API keys do not resync automatically. You can trigger syncs either programmatically or manually via the dashboard.

<Tip>
  Unlike Production connectors, syncs are not automated for Development connectors. You must trigger syncs manually or programmatically to fetch updated data.
</Tip>

### Connector Limits

There is no limit on the number of connectors you can create in the Development environment, allowing you to test multiple integrations without restrictions.

## Managing Your Development API Key

You can view and regenerate your Development API key from the **API Keys** section of your Bindbee dashboard:

## Environment Isolation

The Development and Production environments are completely isolated:

- Development API keys only access Development data  
- Production API keys only access Production data  
- Connectors and data do not transfer between environments
