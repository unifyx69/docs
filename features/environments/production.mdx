## Overview

The Production environment is where your live customer integrations run. This environment handles real customer data and is completely isolated from the Development environment.

<Warning>
  Production API keys provide access to real customer data. Keep them secure and never expose them publicly.
</Warning>

## Production API Key

Your Production API key (`prod_api_key`) is used exclusively to access the Production environment. It cannot be used to access the Development environment.

### Managing Your Production API Key

You can view and regenerate your Production API key in the [API Keys](https://app.bindbee.dev/settings/keys) section of your Bindbee dashboard.

<Note>
  Regenerating your Production API key will immediately invalidate the previous key. Update all services before regenerating.
</Note>

### Authentication

Include your Production API key in the `Authorization` header:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PROD_API_KEY`

## Environment Isolation

The Production and Development environments are completely isolated:
- Production API keys only access Production data
- Development API keys only access Development data
- Connectors and data do not transfer between environments
