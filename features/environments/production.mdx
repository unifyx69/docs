## Overview

The Production environment is used for running live customer integrations. It handles real customer data and is intended for use with customers actively operating in production.

This environment is completely isolated from the Development environment.

<Warning>
  Production API keys provide access to real customer data. Keep them secure and never expose them publicly.
</Warning>

## Production API Key

Your Production API key (`prod_api_key`) is required to access the Production environment. Development API keys cannot be used to authenticate Production requests.

<Note>
  Only Production API keys can be used to access the Production environment.
  Development API keys are strictly limited to the Development environment.
 </Note>

### Managing Your Production API Key

You can view and regenerate your Production API key in the [API Keys](https://app.bindbee.dev/settings/keys) section of your Bindbee dashboard.

<Note>
  Regenerating your Production API key will immediately invalidate the previous key. Ensure all dependent services are updated before regenerating.
</Note>

### Authentication

Include your Production API key in the `Authorization` header for all requests:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PROD_API_KEY`

## Sync Behavior

In the Production environment, data syncs are handled automatically.

<Note>
  Data synchronization occurs once every 24 hours by default. This sync frequency can be adjusted based on customization preferences.
</Note>

## Intended Usage

The Production environment is designed for:
- Live customer integrations
- Real-time and scheduled data synchronization
- Stable, production-ready workflows

It should only be used once integrations have been fully tested in the Development environment.

## Environment Isolation

The Production and Development environments are completely isolated:
- Production API keys only access Production data
- Development API keys only access Development data
- Connectors and data do not transfer between environments
