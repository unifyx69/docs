## Overview

The Test environment is a safe sandbox where you can build, test, and debug your Bindbee integrations without affecting real customer data. This environment is ideal for development, QA testing, and onboarding new team members.

<Tip>
  Use the Test environment to experiment freely with the Bindbee API. Any data created or modified here is isolated from your production environment.
</Tip>

## Test API Keys

Each Bindbee environment has its own set of API keys. Your Test API key authenticates requests to the Bindbee sandbox API and provides access to test data only.

### Sharing Test API Keys

<Info>
  Unlike Production keys, Test API keys can be safely shared with your development team, QA engineers, and external contractors working on your integration.
</Info>

Test API keys are designed to be shared within your organization for:

- **Development teams** building and testing new features
- **QA engineers** validating integration functionality
- **External contractors** or consultants assisting with implementation
- **Demo purposes** to showcase your integration capabilities

### Managing Your Test API Key

You can view and regenerate your Test API key in the [API Keys](https://app.bindbee.dev/settings/keys) section of your Bindbee dashboard.

<Note>
  While Test API keys are safe to share internally, avoid publishing them in public repositories or documentation.
</Note>

### Using Your Test API Key

Include your Test API key in the `Authorization` header of every request to the Bindbee API:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TEST_API_KEY`

## When to Use Test

Use the Test environment when:

- Developing and building new integration features
- Running automated tests and CI/CD pipelines
- Onboarding new developers to your Bindbee integration
- Debugging issues without risking production data
- Demonstrating functionality to stakeholders
