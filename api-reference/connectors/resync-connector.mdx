## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use the Resync API to force a sync of a connector.

<Warning>
  It is neither necessary nor recommended to call this endpoint periodically.
  Bindbee automatically performs periodic syncs for you. You should only trigger
  a resync in specific cases, such as when a user manually initiates a sync from
  your application (e.g., by clicking a “Sync” button).
</Warning>
