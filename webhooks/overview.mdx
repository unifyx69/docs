description: "With Webhooks, you can receive real-time updates on connector sync statuses, as well as notifications whenever HRIS data is created or modified. This ensures you stay up-to-date with the latest changes and maintain accurate, synchronized information across your systems, enhancing your workflow efficiency and data reliability."
---

## Create Webhooks

To create webhooks follow the intructions up ahead!

**Step 1:** Navigate to the “Webhooks” section from the sidebar under the “Configure” menu.

![Webhook New](https://images.unifyx.dev/documentation_images/webhook_name.webp)

**Step 2:** In the “New webhook” section, enter the destination URL where you want to receive the webhook notifications in the “Destination URL” field.

![Webhook Create](https://images.unifyx.dev/documentation_images/webhook_create.webp)

**Step 3:** Optionally, click the “Test URL” button to ensure that your destination URL is correctly set up and can receive test data.

**Step 4:** Provide a meaningful name for your webhook in the “Webhook Name” field. For example, “Employee data.”

**Step 5:** Choose the events for which you want to receive notifications by selecting the appropriate checkboxes:

- **Sync start**: Receive an alert when a connector’s sync starts.
- **Sync error**: Get notified when a connector sync fails.
- **Sync completed**: Get notified when a connector sync job is successful.
- **Employee model change**: Receive an alert when any employee data is modified.
- **Data model change**: Receive an alert when any data model is modified.

**Step 6:** Once you have filled in all the required fields and selected the notification triggers, click the “Create webhook” button to save your webhook configuration.

## Payload Properties

- `connector`: The connector whose data has changed.
- `data`: The affected data model.

## Webhook event types

## Security
To secure your API endpoint, ensure it verifies that POST requests are genuinely from Bindbee and not from a malicious source, and that payloads haven’t been tampered with during transit.
 
You can achieve this by checking if the `X-Bindbee-Webhook-Signature` field in the request header matches an encoded combination of your organization’s unique webhook signature and the payload of the incoming request.
 
In the Webhooks configuration page, you should find a Security section where you can access your signature key. This key is unique to your organization and can be regenerated if it becomes known to an unauthorized party.

## Webhook Visibility
 
The webhook logs are easily visible on the webhooks tab at [Bindbee](https://app.bindbee.dev/logs/webhooks) dashboard. 
The specific webhook logs will be visible on the individual webhook page.
